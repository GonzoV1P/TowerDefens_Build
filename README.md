# TowerDefens_Build

In "Tower Defense", the player takes command of a mighty fortress — the last bastion protecting the magical Heart from endless waves of invading enemies. Each level challenges you to think strategically as you manage resources, place traps, and secure rooms within your tower. The deeper the enemies breach, the greater the danger. Build, upgrade, and plan carefully — only the sharpest strategist will keep the tower standing.

Core Gameplay Mechanics

🧟‍♂️ Enemy Waves – hordes of enemies attack in waves, attempting to infiltrate the tower and reach the Heart chamber.

⚙️ Room System – the tower is divided into multiple rooms that can be reinforced, locked with doors, or filled with traps.

💣 Traps and Defense – place a variety of traps in designated spots to slow down or eliminate enemies before they advance too far.

🏭 Resource Production – underground rooms can host factories that generate resources used to build traps, doors, and upgrades.

🪙 Resource Management – every defensive action costs resources, so balancing between defense and production is key to survival.

🏰 Strategic Placement – every trap, door, and factory must be placed wisely to ensure the best defensive layout.

🔄 Progression and Upgrades – as waves intensify, upgrade your defenses, boost production efficiency, and unlock new types of traps and technologies.
